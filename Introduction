About Me
</h2>
<p>My name is Salvador Pizzo, and I am a native of San Jose, California. I am a student at Foothill College working towards a transfer to a four year university to study my passion: political economy. I am learning code to pick up a new skill, and hopefully use it to transition into a more flexible & better paying work setting. </p>
